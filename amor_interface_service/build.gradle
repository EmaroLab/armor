 Dependencies can be on external maven artifacts (such as rosjava_core
 here) or on sibling subprojects. Fpr external maven artifact dependencies
 it's convenient to use an open ranged dependency, but restrict it to
 cover the patch version only to avoid breakages due to api changes
 which usually occur on minor and major version numbers.
